      <h3>Why I Chose QA and Automation</h3>
      <p>Software quality assurance may seem like a background process, but it’s one of the most critical components in tech. I was drawn to QA because of the meticulous planning it requires and the challenge of building systems that catch what others might miss. Automation has elevated QA to a whole new level—allowing us to test faster, smarter, and more reliably.</p>
