      <h3>Emotion Recognition System</h3>
      <p>
        A real-time facial emotion detection system using <strong>Convolutional Neural Networks</strong> and the <strong>FER2013</strong> dataset. Integrated with <strong>OpenCV</strong> to capture live webcam feeds, classify emotions such as happy, sad, angry, and surprised. Trained with image augmentation and validated using categorical accuracy. Deployed in a desktop environment for psychology research demos.

    <h2>Blog / Reflection</h2>

      <h3>Balancing QA and Product Thinking</h3>
      <p>Being a QA engineer with product responsibilities has taught me the importance of aligning test strategy with user expectations. It's not just about bugsâ€”itâ€™s about how the user feels when something fails. I prioritize automated tests, but I also advocate for usability checks and edge-case simulations. This mindset helps release better, more reliable software and gives developers clear insights into what matters most.</p>

      <h3>Making Machine Learning Practical</h3>
      <p>Machine learning shouldn't just exist in notebooksâ€”it should be usable. My projects aim to bring ML to real users through practical interfaces. From detecting emotions to converting handwriting, I believe intelligent systems should make life easier, not more complex. Iâ€™m passionate about building transparent and human-focused AI tools that explain what they do and how they help.</p>

      <h3>Lessons From Automation Engineering</h3>
      <p>Automation helped me scale quality checks without adding manual effort. From Gherkin-driven tests to API automation, Iâ€™ve implemented scripts that save hours during regression cycles. I learned that automation works best when you design for testability early, collaborate with devs, and document everything. It's not just about testingâ€”itâ€™s about creating confidence in every deploy.</p>
