    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Emotion Recognition System:</strong>  
        Built a real-time facial expression detection app using CNNs and the FER2013 dataset. Augmented data to improve model accuracy and used OpenCV for live webcam input. Accurately classified emotions like happy, sad, and angry with a responsive UI.
      </li>
      <li><strong>OCR Scanner:</strong>  
        Created a text extractor using OpenCV and Tesseract to convert printed images to editable documents. Improved OCR performance by tuning preprocessing techniques and supported output in .txt and .doc formats for practical document digitization.
      </li>
      <li><strong>EduSentral Entrance System:</strong>  
        Android app that enables students to take college entrance exams on smartphones. Features include offline mode, time tracking, randomized questions, and a local SQLite backend to support real-time grading.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Store Sales Forecasting:</strong>  
        Used regression and time-series models on Kaggleâ€™s retail sales dataset. Developed features for weekly trends and holidays using Pandas and evaluated performance with RMSE. The solution helped simulate future inventory strategies.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Nepali Plagiarism Detection:</strong>  
        Built a rule-based NLP tool that detects plagiarism in Devanagari text. Integrated stemming and cosine similarity to identify copied content across multiple documentsâ€”tailored for Nepali academia.

      <h3>Balancing QA and Product Thinking</h3>
      <p>Being a QA engineer with product responsibilities has taught me the importance of aligning test strategy with user expectations. It's not just about bugsâ€”itâ€™s about how the user feels when something fails. I prioritize automated tests, but I also advocate for usability checks and edge-case simulations. This mindset helps release better, more reliable software and gives developers clear insights into what matters most.</p>

      <h3>Making Machine Learning Practical</h3>
      <p>Machine learning shouldn't just exist in notebooksâ€”it should be usable. My projects aim to bring ML to real users through practical interfaces. From detecting emotions to converting handwriting, I believe intelligent systems should make life easier, not more complex. Iâ€™m passionate about building transparent and human-focused AI tools that explain what they do and how they help.</p>

      <h3>Lessons From Automation Engineering</h3>
      <p>Automation helped me scale quality checks without adding manual effort. From Gherkin-driven tests to API automation, Iâ€™ve implemented scripts that save hours during regression cycles. I learned that automation works best when you design for testability early, collaborate with devs, and document everything. It's not just about testingâ€”itâ€™s about creating confidence in every deploy.</p>
